# Module 2 Audio Testing Guide

## Prerequisites
- Module 1 (video conferencing) working correctly
- Microphone connected and working
- Speakers or headphones connected
- At least 2 computers on the same LAN

## Quick Test (2 Clients)

### Step 1: Start Server
```bash
python src/server/server.py
```
Expected output:
```
[HH:MM:SS] Server started on <IP>:5000
[HH:MM:SS] Video streaming on port 5001
[HH:MM:SS] Audio streaming on port 5002
```

### Step 2: Start Client 1
```bash
python src/client/client.py
```
1. Enter server IP address
2. Enter username (e.g., "Alice")
3. Click "Connect"

Expected behavior:
- Video window opens
- Camera LED turns on
- See your own video feed

### Step 3: Start Client 2
```bash
python src/client/client.py
```
1. Enter same server IP
2. Enter different username (e.g., "Bob")
3. Click "Connect"

Expected behavior:
- Both clients see each other's video
- Grid layout shows 2 video streams

### Step 4: Test Audio
**On Client 1 (Alice):**
1. Speak into microphone: "Hello, can you hear me?"

**On Client 2 (Bob):**
- Should hear Alice's voice through speakers/headphones
- Latency should be under 50ms (nearly instant)

**On Client 2 (Bob):**
1. Speak into microphone: "Yes, I can hear you!"

**On Client 1 (Alice):**
- Should hear Bob's voice
- Should NOT hear echo of own voice (server doesn't send audio back to sender)

### Step 5: Test Microphone Toggle
**On Client 1:**
1. Click "ðŸŽ¤ Microphone" button
   - Button should turn red
   - Microphone icon may show strikethrough (âŠ—ðŸŽ¤)
2. Speak into microphone

**On Client 2:**
- Should NOT hear Client 1's voice
- Video should still be visible

**On Client 1:**
1. Click "ðŸŽ¤ Microphone" again
   - Button should turn green
2. Speak again

**On Client 2:**
- Should hear Client 1's voice again

### Step 6: Test Speaker Toggle
**On Client 2:**
1. Click "ðŸ”Š Speaker" button
   - Button should turn red
2. Have Client 1 speak

**On Client 2:**
- Should NOT hear any audio
- Can still speak (microphone still active)

1. Click "ðŸ”Š Speaker" again
   - Button should turn green

**On Client 2:**
- Should hear audio again

### Step 7: Test Simultaneous Speech
**Both Clients:**
1. Speak at the same time
   - Both should hear mixed audio
   - Volume may be slightly lower (averaging effect)
   - No severe distortion or clipping

## Advanced Test (3+ Clients)

### Step 1: Add Third Client
```bash
python src/client/client.py
```
- Enter username "Charlie"
- Connect to server

Expected:
- All 3 clients see each other's video
- Grid layout automatically adjusts

### Step 2: Test Multi-Person Audio
1. **Client 1** speaks alone
   - Clients 2 and 3 hear clearly
2. **Client 2** speaks alone
   - Clients 1 and 3 hear clearly
3. **Client 3** speaks alone
   - Clients 1 and 2 hear clearly
4. **All 3 speak simultaneously**
   - All hear mixed audio
   - Volume lower but intelligible

### Step 3: Test Selective Muting
1. **Client 2** mutes microphone
2. **Clients 1 and 3** speak
   - Only they hear each other
   - Client 2 hears both but isn't heard
3. **Client 2** unmutes
   - All can communicate again

## Performance Monitoring

### Server-Side Metrics
Watch server console for:
```
[HH:MM:SS] Audio packet from user_alice (1024 bytes)
[HH:MM:SS] Audio packet from user_bob (1024 bytes)
[HH:MM:SS] Mixed audio broadcasted to 2 clients
```

### Client-Side Metrics
Monitor client console for:
```
[HH:MM:SS] Started audio capture
[HH:MM:SS] Started audio playback
[HH:MM:SS] Audio streaming active
```

### Network Bandwidth
Expected usage per client:
- **Upload**: ~88 KB/s (audio) + ~100 KB/s (video) = ~188 KB/s
- **Download**: ~88 KB/s (audio) + (~100 KB/s Ã— N clients video) 

For 3 clients:
- Each uploads: ~188 KB/s
- Each downloads: ~88 KB/s + 300 KB/s = ~388 KB/s

## Troubleshooting

### No Audio Heard
**Symptoms**: Video works, but no audio
**Checks**:
1. Server console shows "Audio streaming on port 5002" âœ“
2. Client console shows "Started audio capture" and "Started audio playback" âœ“
3. Microphone permissions granted (check OS settings)
4. Speaker volume not muted or at 0%
5. Windows: Check "Sound Settings" â†’ ensure correct input/output devices
6. Linux: Check PulseAudio/ALSA mixer settings

**Debug**:
```python
# In client.py, add debug prints in capture_and_send_audio():
print(f"Captured audio: {len(audio_data)} bytes")

# In receive_audio_stream():
print(f"Received audio: {len(data)} bytes")
```

### Audio Cutting Out
**Symptoms**: Audio stutters or drops
**Possible Causes**:
1. Network congestion (check with ping)
2. High CPU usage (check Task Manager / top)
3. Too many clients (reduce count or optimize)

**Solutions**:
- Reduce video quality (lower FPS or resolution)
- Close other network-intensive applications
- Use wired Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi

### Echo/Feedback
**Symptoms**: Hear own voice repeated or loud squealing
**Cause**: Audio from speakers picked up by microphone
**Solution**:
- Use headphones instead of speakers
- Reduce speaker volume
- Move microphone farther from speakers
- (Future) Implement echo cancellation

### High Latency
**Symptoms**: Delay > 100ms between speaking and hearing
**Checks**:
1. Ping server: `ping <server_ip>`
   - Should be < 5ms on LAN
2. Check server CPU usage
   - Should be < 50% for 4 clients
3. Check AUDIO_CHUNK size in config.py
   - Larger chunk = higher latency but less jitter

**Debug Latency**:
Add timestamps to measure round-trip:
```python
# Client speaks "beep" at HH:MM:SS.000
# Client hears mixed "beep" at HH:MM:SS.025
# Latency = 25ms âœ“
```

### Microphone Toggle Not Working
**Symptoms**: Button clicks but audio still transmits
**Checks**:
1. Console shows "Stopped audio capture" âœ“
2. Check `audio_capturing` flag is False
3. Verify thread actually stopped (debug print in capture loop)

### Speaker Toggle Not Working
**Symptoms**: Button clicks but audio still plays
**Checks**:
1. Console shows "Stopped audio playback" âœ“
2. Check `audio_playing` flag is False
3. Verify thread actually stopped

### PyAudio Errors
**Error**: `OSError: [Errno -9997] Invalid sample rate`
**Solution**: Microphone doesn't support 44100 Hz
```python
# In config.py, try different rates:
AUDIO_RATE = 48000  # or 16000, 22050, 44100
```

**Error**: `OSError: [Errno -9996] Invalid output device`
**Solution**: No speakers detected
- Check speaker connection
- Check OS audio output settings
- Try different PyAudio device index

**Error**: `IOError: [Errno -9981] Input overflowed`
**Solution**: CPU can't keep up with audio capture
```python
# In start_audio_capture(), add exception_on_overflow=False:
self.audio_stream_input = self.pyaudio_instance.open(
    format=AUDIO_FORMAT,
    channels=AUDIO_CHANNELS,
    rate=AUDIO_RATE,
    input=True,
    frames_per_buffer=AUDIO_CHUNK,
    exception_on_overflow=False  # Add this
)
```

## Success Criteria

- âœ… No crashes or freezes during normal operation
- âœ… Clean resource cleanup on disconnect
- âœ… GUI controls responsive and intuitive

## Next Steps After Testing

Once Module 2 is verified working:
