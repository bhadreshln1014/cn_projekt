# Video Layout System

## Available Layouts

### 1. **Tiled Layout** (Grid View)
- All participants shown in equal-sized tiles
- Grid adapts to number of participants
- Best for: Small meetings (≤4 people), equal participation

### 2. **Spotlight Layout** (Main + Sidebar)
- **Main area**: Shows primary content (presenter's screen or main speaker)
- **Sidebar**: Shows thumbnails of other participants
- Best for: Presentations, screen sharing, large meetings

## Manual Layout Control

Two layout buttons are available in the bottom-right control bar:

- **Grid icon** (⊞): Switch to Tiled layout
- **Person icon** (◉): Switch to Spotlight layout

### Button States:
- **Blue background**: Currently active layout
- **Gray background**: Inactive layout
- **Hover effect**: Shows which button you're hovering over

## Layout Behavior

### Without Screen Sharing:
- **Tiled**: All participants in grid view
- **Spotlight**: One participant featured in main area, others in sidebar

### With Screen Sharing:
- **Tiled**: Screen + participants shown in grid
- **Spotlight**: Screen in main area, participants in sidebar (recommended)

## Manual vs Auto Switching

**Previous behavior (Auto mode):**
- Automatically switched based on participant count
- Switched to spotlight when screen sharing started
- Limited user control

**New behavior (Manual mode):**
- User has full control via layout buttons
- Layout persists across screen sharing sessions
- No automatic switching
- Your chosen layout remains until you change it

## Best Practices

1. **For Presentations**: Use Spotlight layout
2. **For Discussions**: Use Tiled layout
3. **For Large Meetings**: Use Spotlight layout to focus on active speaker
4. **Screen Sharing**: Spotlight recommended for better visibility

## Tips
