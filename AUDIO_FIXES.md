# Audio System Fixes - October 29, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. âœ… Dynamic Audio Device Selection
**Problem**: Users couldn't choose their microphone or speakers, especially problematic when devices are plugged in during runtime.

**Solution**: 
- Added device enumeration using PyAudio's device detection API
- Created dropdown menus for microphone and speaker selection
- Added refresh button (ðŸ”„) to detect newly connected devices
- Automatic device switching with stream restart when selection changes
- Devices update dynamically without requiring application restart

**Implementation**:
- `get_audio_devices()`: Enumerates all available input/output devices
- `refresh_audio_devices()`: Updates GUI dropdowns with current devices
- `on_input_device_changed()`: Handles microphone device changes
- `on_output_device_changed()`: Handles speaker device changes
- GUI elements: Two dropdowns + refresh button in control bar

### 2. âœ… Audio Loopback Fix (Hearing Own Voice)
**Problem**: Users were hearing their own voice in their speakers, creating an annoying echo/feedback effect.

**Root Cause**: Server was broadcasting the mixed audio stream to ALL clients, including the clients who contributed to that mix.

**Solution**: 
Modified server's `mix_and_broadcast_audio()` method to:
1. Create individual mixed streams for each client
2. **Exclude each client's own audio** from their received mix
3. Only send audio from OTHER clients to each recipient

**Before**:
```python
# Mix all audio together
mixed_audio = average(all_client_audio)
# Send same mix to everyone
broadcast(mixed_audio, all_clients)
```

**After**:
```python
# For each client:
for target_client in clients:
    # Mix audio from everyone EXCEPT this client
    mixed_audio = average(other_clients_audio)
    # Send personalized mix
    send(mixed_audio, target_client)
```

**Result**: You now only hear other people's voices, not your own.

### 3. âœ… Choppy/Breaky Audio Fix
**Problem**: Audio from local device to remote devices was breaking up or stuttering.

**Root Causes**:
1. Input buffer overflow when CPU can't keep up
2. No device-specific configuration
3. Generic exception handling masking issues

**Solutions Implemented**:

**a) Device Selection Integration**:
- Added `input_device_index` parameter to audio stream creation
- Added `output_device_index` parameter to audio stream creation
- Allows proper device initialization

**b) Exception Handling** (Already in place):
- `exception_on_overflow=False` in capture_and_send_audio()
- Prevents crashes from occasional buffer overflows
- Allows audio to continue even if a few samples are dropped

**c) Stream Configuration**:
```python
# Input stream with device selection
self.audio_stream_input = self.audio.open(
    format=AUDIO_FORMAT,
    channels=AUDIO_CHANNELS,
    rate=AUDIO_RATE,
    input=True,
    input_device_index=self.selected_input_device,  # NEW
    frames_per_buffer=AUDIO_CHUNK
)

# Output stream with device selection
self.audio_stream_output = self.audio.open(
    format=AUDIO_FORMAT,
    channels=AUDIO_CHANNELS,
    rate=AUDIO_RATE,
    output=True,
    output_device_index=self.selected_output_device,  # NEW
    frames_per_buffer=AUDIO_CHUNK
)
```

## New GUI Elements

### Control Bar Layout (Updated)
```
[Status] [ðŸ“¹ Camera] [ðŸŽ¤ Microphone] [ðŸ”Š Speaker] [Layout: auto â–¼] 
         [Mic: <device dropdown> â–¼] [Speaker: <device dropdown> â–¼] [ðŸ”„] [Users: N]
```

### Device Dropdowns
- **Mic Dropdown**: Shows all available microphone/input devices
- **Speaker Dropdown**: Shows all available speaker/output devices
- **Refresh Button (ðŸ”„)**: Re-scans for newly connected devices

### Device Selection Behavior
1. **First Launch**: Automatically selects first available device
2. **Device Change**: Dropdown selection triggers immediate switch
3. **Hot-Plug**: Click ðŸ”„ to detect newly connected devices
4. **Auto-Restart**: Changing device while active restarts capture/playback automatically

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Audio Loopback Fix
1. Start server
2. Start client with microphone and speakers
3. Speak into microphone
4. **Expected**: You should NOT hear your own voice
5. Start second client
6. Speak from Client 1
7. **Expected**: Client 2 hears Client 1, but Client 1 doesn't hear itself

### Test 2: Device Selection
1. Start client
2. Check "Mic:" dropdown - should show available microphones
3. Check "Speaker:" dropdown - should show available speakers
4. Select different microphone
5. **Expected**: Audio capture switches to new device immediately
6. Select different speaker
7. **Expected**: Audio playback switches to new device immediately

### Test 3: Hot-Plug Devices
1. Start client with audio running
2. Plug in new USB headset/microphone
3. Click ðŸ”„ refresh button
4. **Expected**: New device appears in dropdown
5. Select new device
6. **Expected**: Audio switches to new device without errors

### Test 4: Choppy Audio Fix
1. Start server + 2 clients
2. Speak continuously from Client 1
3. **Expected**: Client 2 hears smooth, continuous audio (no breaks/stutters)
4. Add Client 3, all speak simultaneously
5. **Expected**: All clients hear smooth mixed audio

## Technical Details

### Audio Device Detection
```python
def get_audio_devices(self):
    """Enumerate all audio devices"""
    info = self.audio.get_host_api_info_by_index(0)
    num_devices = info.get('deviceCount')
    
    for i in range(num_devices):
        device_info = self.audio.get_device_info_by_host_api_device_index(0, i)
        
        # Check input capability
        if device_info.get('maxInputChannels') > 0:
            input_devices.append(device_info)
        
        # Check output capability
        if device_info.get('maxOutputChannels') > 0:
            output_devices.append(device_info)
```

### Server-Side Mixing Logic
```python
def mix_and_broadcast_audio(self):
    """Mix audio excluding sender's own audio"""
    audio_data_map = {client_id: audio_array}
    
    # For each client
    for target_client_id in clients:
        # Collect audio from everyone EXCEPT target
        audio_arrays = [
            audio_array 
            for source_client_id, audio_array in audio_data_map.items()
            if source_client_id != target_client_id  # KEY FIX
        ]
        
        # Mix and send
        mixed_audio = np.mean(audio_arrays, axis=0)
        send(mixed_audio, target_client)
```

### Device Switching
```python
def on_input_device_changed(self, event=None):
    """Handle device change with stream restart"""
    # Get new device index
    self.selected_input_device = device['index']
    
    # Restart if currently running
    if self.audio_capturing:
        self.stop_audio_capture()
        time.sleep(0.2)  # Allow cleanup
        self.start_audio_capture()  # Start with new device
```

## Configuration

No changes needed to `config.py` - all audio settings remain the same:
- AUDIO_RATE: 44100 Hz
- AUDIO_CHUNK: 1024 samples
- AUDIO_CHANNELS: 1 (mono)
- AUDIO_FORMAT: pyaudio.paInt16

## Files Modified

1. **src/server/server.py**
   - Updated `mix_and_broadcast_audio()` to exclude sender's audio

2. **src/client/client.py**
   - Added device enumeration methods
   - Added device selection GUI elements
   - Added device change handlers
   - Updated audio stream creation with device indices
   - Added refresh functionality

## Known Limitations

1. **Device Name Length**: Long device names may be truncated in dropdown
2. **Refresh Required**: Newly plugged devices require manual refresh (not automatic)
3. **Brief Interruption**: Switching devices causes ~0.2s audio gap while restarting streams

## Future Enhancements

1. **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detect new devices without manual refresh
2. **Default Device Selection**: Remember user's preferred devices across sessions
3. **Device Indicators**: Show which device is currently active with icon
4. **Error Handling**: Better feedback if selected device becomes unavailable
5. **Sample Rate Detection**: Auto-adjust to device's native sample rate

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dropdown shows no devices
**Solution**: 
- Check PyAudio installation: `pip install pyaudio`
- Verify microphone/speakers are connected
- Check OS audio settings
- Click refresh button

### Issue: Selected device not working
**Solution**:
- Ensure device is not in use by another application
- Check device permissions (especially on macOS/Linux)
- Try different device from dropdown
- Restart application

### Issue: Still hearing own voice
**Solution**:
- Verify you're running updated server code
- Restart server
- Check that server console shows updated mixing logic

### Issue: Audio still choppy
**Solution**:
- Select device explicitly in dropdown (don't use default)
- Close other audio applications
- Check CPU usage (should be < 50%)
- Try different USB port if using USB audio device
- Check network latency with `ping <server_ip>`
