# Module 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Module 1 (Multi-User Video Conferencing) has been successfully implemented with all required features.

## Implementation Details

### ✅ Video Capture & Transmission
- **Technology**: OpenCV (cv2) for webcam capture
- **Resolution**: 640x480 pixels at 30 FPS
- **Compression**: JPEG encoding at 60% quality for efficient network transmission
- **Protocol**: UDP for low-latency video streaming
- **Frame Format**: Each frame is prefixed with 4-byte client ID for identification

### ✅ Server-Side Broadcasting
- **Architecture**: Multi-threaded server handling concurrent connections
- **TCP Socket (Port 5000)**: 
  - User authentication and session management
  - Client ID assignment
  - User list broadcasting
  - Graceful connection/disconnection handling
- **UDP Socket (Port 5001)**:
  - Receives video streams from all clients
  - Broadcasts each stream to all other connected clients
  - No video processing on server (relay only)
- **Session Management**:
  - Tracks up to 10 concurrent users
  - Maintains user metadata (ID, username, addresses)
  - Updates all clients when users join/leave

### ✅ Client-Side Rendering
- **Multi-Stream Display**: 3x3 grid layout supporting up to 9 simultaneous video streams
- **Real-Time Decoding**: Receives and decompresses JPEG frames from UDP packets
- **Self-Preview**: Displays own webcam feed alongside other participants
- **User Identification**: Labels each video stream with username
- **Update Rate**: ~30 FPS GUI refresh for smooth playback

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Client-Server Architecture**
   - Centralized server manages all connections
   - Clients communicate only with server (star topology)
   - LAN-only operation (no internet required)

2. **Network Efficiency**
   - UDP for video (low latency, acceptable packet loss)
   - TCP for control (reliable message delivery)
   - JPEG compression reduces bandwidth by ~90%

3. **User Interface**
   - Clean tkinter-based GUI
   - Connection dialog for server IP and username entry
   - Status bar showing connection info and user count
   - Dynamic grid that adapts to number of participants

4. **Robustness**
   - Graceful handling of client disconnections
   - Automatic cleanup of resources
   - Thread-safe data structures with locks
   - Error handling for network and camera failures

```

## Testing Instructions

### Local Testing (Same Computer)
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Server
python src/server/server.py

# Terminal 2 - Client 1
python src/client/client.py
# Enter: Server IP = 127.0.0.1, Username = Alice

# Terminal 3 - Client 2
python src/client/client.py
# Enter: Server IP = 127.0.0.1, Username = Bob
```

### LAN Testing (Multiple Computers)
1. Start server on one computer, note its IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
2. On other computers, run client and connect to server IP
3. Each client should see all other participants' video feeds

## Technical Specifications

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Video Resolution | 640x480 |
| Frame Rate | 30 FPS |
| Compression | JPEG (60% quality) |
| Protocol (Video) | UDP |
| Protocol (Control) | TCP |
| TCP Port | 5000 |
| UDP Port | 5001 |
| Max Users | 10 |
| Max Displayed Streams | 9 (3x3 grid) |

## Network Protocol Details

### TCP Messages
- `CONNECT:<username>` → Server: Client requests connection
- `ID:<client_id>` → Client: Server assigns unique ID
- `USERS:<hex_encoded_pickle>` → Clients: Updated user list
- `PING` / `PONG`: Heartbeat (keepalive)

### UDP Packets
- Structure: `[4 bytes: uint32 client_id][N bytes: JPEG data]`
- Direction: Bidirectional (Client ↔ Server ↔ Other Clients)

## Performance Optimizations

1. **JPEG Compression**: Reduces raw frame size from ~900KB to ~50KB
2. **UDP Streaming**: Eliminates TCP overhead and retransmission delays
3. **Multi-Threading**: Server handles each client in separate thread
4. **Frame Buffering**: Only latest frame stored, old frames discarded
5. **GUI Throttling**: 33ms update interval balances smoothness and CPU usage

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- No audio support (Module 2)
- No persistent chat (Module 3)
- No screen sharing (Module 4)
- No file transfer (Module 5)
- Fixed grid layout (doesn't scale beyond 9 streams)

### Potential Enhancements for Module 1
- Adaptive bitrate based on network conditions
- H.264 encoding for better compression
- Variable grid layout (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4)
- Full-screen mode for active speaker
- Recording functionality
- Bandwidth monitoring and stats
